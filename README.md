# Example iNaturalist dashboard for current local observations

A quick little viewer to show the species (plants, birds or mammals) seen around Boulder County, CO over a two week window to demo the iNaturalist search API. 

The [dashboard](https://married-soy.glitch.me) shows an example observation from each species observed over that time period:

(limited to the most recent 100 observations).

This uses the speedy node.js based [iNaturalist API](http://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/#!/Observations/get_observations) with [additional documentation](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference#get-observations) available. 


## Remixing!

Most of the search parameters are not used by this demo! Check out client.js for the parameters used for the dashboard if, say, you're not in Boulder County.
